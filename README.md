# Evaluating Collaborative Forecasting in Non-Horizontal Federated Learning
Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving and decentralized machine learning approach that requires attention in collaborative forecasting problems when parties do not share the same input feature space. Computing a global AI model by joining parties' models that differ in architecture and input space prompts us to consider evaluating the predictive variability in collaborative forecasting.  In collaborative prognostics, where multiple condition monitoring systems enhance the machinery's useful lifetime forecast, our approach begins by partitioning turbofan engine sensor signals from the C-MAPSS dataset among different parties. Utilizing  Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning (VAFL) algorithm, we successfully address the Federated Learning experiment through two architectures: Multilayer Perceptron followed by a Kalman Filter (MLP-KF) and Functional Multilayer Perceptron (FMLP). In the final step, we assessed multiple models per party by repeating the experiment for each architecture and used appropriate key metrics to compare prediction variability among parties and experiments. The evaluation revealed that FMLP outperformed MLP-KF, providing more stable and reproducible predictions.
